					<h3>Coordinate System.</h3>
						<ul class="list-2">
						<li class="contents-2">Establish a position coordinate s along the path and specify its fixed origin and positive direction.</li>
						<li class="contents-2">Since motion is along a straight line, the vector quantities position, velocity, and acceleration can be represented as algebraic scalars. For analytical work the sense of <em>s, v, </em> and <em>a</em> is then defined by their <em>algebraic signs.</em></li>
						<li class="contents-2">The positive sense for each of these scalars can be indicated by an arrow shown alongside each kinematic equation as it is applied.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Kinematic Equations.</h3>
						<ul class="list-2">
							<li class="contents-2">If a relation is known between any <em> two</em> of the four variables <em>a, v, s, </em> and <em>t</em>, then a third variable can be obtained by using one of the kinematic equations, <em>a = dv>dt, v = ds>dt </em> or a <em>ds = v dv,</em> since each equation relates all three variables.*</li>
							<li class="contents-2">Whenever integration is performed, it is important that the position and velocity be known at a given instant in order to evaluate either the constant of integration if an indefinite integral is used, or the limits of integration if a definite integral is used.</li>
							<li class="contents-2">Remember that Eqs. 12–4 through 12–6 have only limited use. These equations apply <em>only</em> when the<em> acceleration is constant</em> and the initial conditions are <em>s = s0</em> and<em> v = v0</em> when <em>t</em> = 0.</li>
